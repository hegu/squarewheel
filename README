The initial plan was to build an distributed and replicated key value store. 
The python language was suggested and the io library twisted looked very promising.

Some initial thoughts:
* Inspired by leader election from ZAB/Zookeeper
* Have partion leader where 2 or 4 followers are spread on other nodes.
* Keys are spread over partions
* To get good spread and balance the number of partions must be many more than the nodes

Limitations on expected system
* Configured set of nodes
* Many reads few writes
* Low probability of change of nodes but must be able to extend or upgrade without service break
